== 2011-04-03 / Version 2.3.3
* Option to hide the calendar header
* Add ec-other-month-bg CSS style
* Remove possible jquery/prototype conflict
* Improved handling of 'events' of different class types

== 2010-12-29 / Version 2.3.2
* Use aliased attributes throughout
* RSpec 2 compatibility

== 2010-11-17 / Version 2.3.1
* Install as a gem in Rails 3

== 2010-07-02 / Version 2.3
* Added Rails 3 generators
* Minor improvement to the generated route. Default year and month are set in the controller instead.

== 2010-06-14 / Version 2.2
* Refactored plugin pattern to allow for class attributes.
* You can now pass in custom column names for the start and end fields.
    has_event_calendar :start_at_field  => 'custom_start_at', :end_at_field => 'custom_end_at'
* Can pass additional find conditions to event_strips_for_month.
* Added rpsec with a few specs.

== 2009-12-09 / Version 2.1
* Added the 'use_all_day' option. If this is set to true (by default it is false), it will check for an 'all_day' boolean field when displaying an event. If it is an all day event, or the event is multiple days, then it will display as usual. Otherwise it will display without a background color bar.
* Added a --use-all-day option to the generator
* Note, if updating, you will need to slightly change your helper. The block parameters passed to the calendar method are now in an argument hash. (More flexible, and future changes won't have this problem.) See the example in README for more.
    calendar event_calendar_options do |args|
      event = args[:event]
      ...
    end
* Javascript handles highlighting non-all-day events
* Re-factored javascript to be unobtrusive

* Removed legacy options, comments, and code
* Caution, not backwards compatible with some of Version 1's options

== 2009-11-11 / Version 1
* The initial EventCalendar Rails Plugin
* Most bugs and issues have been resolved
* Works, but isn't as flexible as desired
