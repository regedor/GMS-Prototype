posts_bodies = ["HyperMac is known more for its power-extending solutions than its other peripherals, but this still-unannounced iPad external hard drive enclosure we spotted at the company's booth is certainly interesting. Capable of accepting a standard 2.5-inch hard drive, the brushed metal box has two miniUSB ports around back -- one to connect to your computer, and another to connect to your iPad. Unfortunately, unlike other iPad storage solutions like the AirStash, because it interfaces through Apple's USB camera adapter, you're limited to photos and video content only. On top of that, it only works with the iPad because the iPhone and iPod touch don't support that particular accessory. The target price point is around $100 without any physical drive -- yes, it's a BYOHD affair -- which is definitely steeper than we'd like, especially given the limited functionality. Still, if you've got more content than space to spare, you might want to look into picking one of these up when it drops in sometime later this month."
         ,"There was a time when we studied maps to figure out where we were going. Then there was a time when we went online and printed out directions before we left. Now we pretty much just jump in our cars and put all our faith in the Lady of the Dash (clad in shimmering samite), but Ford wants to give you a little more control over her. Back when it was still 2010 (barely) the company announced SYNC Destinations, enabling you to plan your route in detail before you even get in the car. Now we got a chance to play with it and, while it's simple, it certainly does seem useful. Check out the video after the break."
         ,"2011 is shaping up to be the year consumer-grade 3D camcorders take off. Now JVC is in the mix with its new GS-TD1 full HD 3D camcorder which it touts as a world first. Thanks to twin 3D HD GT lenses, two 3.32 megapixel CMOS sensors and a newly announced Falconbrid 3D image chip, the device can record both left and right streams of 1920 x 1080i simultaneously. It also features 5x zoom and 64GB of flash memory that can be expanded via an SD card slot. Besides the full HD mode, the camera supports the more common side-by-side format AVCHD 3D as well as AVCHD 2D. For better in-field review, the device packs a 3.5-inch glasses free 3D touch panel screen. Outside of 3D video, the camera is additionally equipped to record so-called 3D sound using BIPHONIC sound processing. Pricing is pegged at just under $2,000 and is expected to be available for purchase this March. For the full details check out the PR after the break."
         ,"Alright, the past two days have been insanity, meaning our live Engadget Podcast Shows have happened at an ungodly hour, no matter which end of the US you happen to live. Today is totally insane too, but we're going to take a break from the insanity to do an insane live show at 8PM Vegas Local Time (VLT), or 11PM EST, if that's more your bag. We can't promise to be any more coherent than the last two nights, but we can promise to be just as attractive and twice as argumentative. Don't miss it. The stream and the chat are after the break."
         ,"Samsung already had a hyperspeed press conference that touched on all aspects of its business (did you know Samsung is the number one vendor of French door refrigerators in the US?), but the company has been teasing its CES keynote today as being a completely unique event. We'll see how true that is -- we're here and ready to rock."
         ,"Apple itself might not be at CES, but the prospective upgrade of its iPad to version two has accessory manufacturers (or at least manufacturers' imaginations) working overtime. We've just come across our second iPad 2 mockup, this one a lot more comprehensive than the first, which seems to mesh well with some earlier imagery we've seen of the supposed next-gen Apple tablet. Not only that, its rear label reveals an A1337 product code -- one that's also shared by the current iPad WiFi + 3G -- and lists 128GB of onboard storage, two times the current tablet's maximum. We don't know what material it's made out of, but it felt felt the same as the current iPad's aluminum shell. All that said, this is still just a mockup from a no-name accessory maker and we're just as willing to believe it was put together on the basis of some decent rumor research as we are to think that it really is the iPad 2. No harm in browsing some pictures of this 9.4mm-thick device, though eh?"
         ,"General Imaging is mixing some of the old in with the new here at CES, but it does look to be slowly but steadily improving its game when it comes to its GE-branded cameras. One of the standouts is the X500 bridge camera (pictured above), which packs 16 megapixels, a 15x optical zoom, an electronic viewfinder, and plenty of manual controls to go along with the usual point-and-shoot features -- all for $150 (actual image quality is another matter, of course). It's joined by the E1680W, E1450W, J1470S, A1456W, and C1433 point-and-shoots, which all pack 14 or 16 megapixels, 3x to 8x optical zooms, and varying degrees of thinness for between $80 and $160 dollars. Hit up the press release after the break for some more details, and look for all the new cameras to roll out in February or March."
         ,"Not so fond of the resistance level on that stock Xbox 360 controller? Hello, solution! Razer just trotted out the Tournament Edition and Standard Edition controllers, and we stopped by to have a look. The company told us that it has been working on perfecting the resistance mechanism on the Tournament Edition ($49.99) for months on end, and the end product was as solid as a rock. Both analog joysticks are capable of being independently tightened or loosened with respect to resistance, and it also touts an added shoulder button that can be reassigned to do pretty much anything via an intuitive button / menu process on the rear of the controller -- that's shown in more detail down in the gallery below. There's also a rubberized feel to the grip, backlit buttons and a braided cable, whereas the $39.99 Standard edition lacks the adjustable resistance, backlighting, rubber finish and cable braiding."
         ,"We've been dying to play with a third-party AirPlay speaker system ever since Apple opened the tech up, and iHome was happy to oblige here at CES with the new iW1. The wireless speaker system features two three-inch woofers and two one-inch tweeters with Bongiovi audio processing, a built-in lithium-ion battery with a grab-and-go charging base, and capacitive touch controls -- and, just as we suspected, AirPlay compatibility courtesy of BridgeCo. iHome's also developed a new iOS configuration app called iHome Connect that'll help you get the iW1 on your WiFi network quickly, although regular WPS setup is also supported. You can also charge your iPhone or iPod by plugging into the USB port in the back -- iHome is packing a cable in the box."
         ,"So, Microsoft doesn't have a press-ready demo of its new Avatar Kinect, but we at least got to see it in action today. To keep the unwashed masses lining up to try Kinect at the booth entertained, Microsoft has a comedian (dubbed 'Mr. Kinect') controlling an Avatar with Kinect, heckling the queued-up folks with his digital puppetry. The good news is that he's working it from a seated position, the great dream of folks tired of standing up to get their motion gaming on. The bad news is that you only get control of your arms, face, and head -- you won't be walking around and punching your friends in the face, sadly. We saw a couple of settings -- sadly, not the AA-style setup we witnessed during the keynote -- which are pleasant but a little generic (like most of Microsoft's Kinect titles right now)."
         ,"Now look what we have here, the long awaited HDHomeRun Prime triple CableCARD tuner for Windows 7 Media Center. Originally announced at CES last year, the little black perforated box is already in production and will soon be selling for $250 after it makes it ways through the final stages of CableLabs certification. The sad fact is there is no way to know when that cert will be sealed, but when it is you'll be able to pre-order and then you can expect to receive it 30 days later. The other little tidbits we picked up from the booth is that SiliconDust is working on a six tuner rack mountable version that should ship later this year and that the ATSC and QAM version we've loved for years has a new case a new price of $129 and will be shipping in February."
         ,"Got a hankering for some NVIDIA 3D Vision in a new laptop PC? Dell's making it happen with some component upgrades on its high-end Alienware M17x and XPS 17 laptops. It seems Round Rock came across a few shipments of a 17-inch, 1080p panel with a 120Hz refresh rate, perfect for interfacing with NVIDIA's shutter glasses, and is including it (along with a new NVIDIA GeForce GT 555M for the XPS 17) as premium options. They'll also both sport Intel's new Sandy Bridge processors. Dell's press release doesn't specify if a set of 3D glasses will come with the new laptops, nor how much the upgrade will cost, but a 3D-capable M17x will start at $1,499 starting January 10th, and a stereoscopic XPS 17 will run $1,449 on February 1st. You do the math."
         ,"The original plush Chumby will always hold a special place in our hearts, but let's be real: the average human doesn't know what to do with a plush, huggable touchscreen that runs Flash Lite. The new Chumby 8 -- leaked not long ago -- is now official, featuring a revamped user interface that allows you to access music from the home screen, manage apps without using the web-based portal, and use internet radio stations as alarm sounds. Where does the "8" in the name come from, exactly? That'd be the 8-inch 800 x 600 resistive touchscreen, a heck of a lot bigger than the 3.5 inches on that Chumby One you've got kicking around."
         ,"The LG Revolution, HTC Thunderbolt and Samsung's SCH-i520 were the obvious stars of Verizon's 4G LTE presser today, but a truckload of lesser devices are sure to delight end users when they ship later in the year. 4G mobile hotspots were on hand from both Novatel Wireless and Samsung (with the former working on both 3G and 4G networks), as were a pair of netbooks from HP and the LTE-enabled (and Hummingbird-powered) Galaxy Tab. The MiFi devices were decidedly thicker than our existing MiFi 2200 (shown left, above), but it's a price we'd be willing to pay for the ability to surf on both of VZW's networks. Gallery's below for those seeking a closer look, and you should expect the whole lot to hit your local VZW store between March and July."
         ,"We've always thought that Xi3's Modular Computer was a downright brilliant design, but up until now, we've had no real understanding of how it would be exploited. Here at CES, the company has answered that very question, and answered it well. The new Z3RO is little more than a dumb terminal, but if you're considering a second household PC for the most mundane of tasks, it just might be the solution you're looking for. You'll need one of the firm's Modular Computers to start, and from there you can connect up to three Z3RO terminals. Each one is equipped with a VGA port, USB sockets and audio jacks; once it's connected to the mothership (read: the Modular Computer), each Z3RO taps into its 2.0GHz computer and creates an entirely new instance on whatever monitor it's connected to. It's generally meant for small businesses and libraries, but we're certain the educational world could benefit from the setup as well. It's expected to hit mass production at the end of March, but we're told that it's available today for an undisclosed amount in limited quantities. If you're interested in doing the math, a single Modular Computer along with three Z3ROs will net you a per-seat price of $350. A shot of the rear awaits you after the break."]
